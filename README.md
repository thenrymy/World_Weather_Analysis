# Module 6 Challenge

## Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

## Python Library
- https://pypi.org/project/citipy/

## API
- https://openweathermap.org/api (used in WeatherPy.ipynb)
- https://apidocs.geoapify.com (used in VacationPy.ipynb)
